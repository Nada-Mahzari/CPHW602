'''
Write a Python script that performs the following tasks:
'''
'''
1. Create Data:                                                                Create a list of strings: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].                       ''' 
''' 
2. Save Data:                                                                  Write a function named save_to_file(data, filename) that takes a list of strings and a filename as input and writes each string to a new line in a text file with the given filename.
'''                                                                            ''' 
infile = open('filename_data.txt', 'r')                                                
data = infile.read()                                                            
print(data)                                                                     
infile.close()
'''
'''
3. Main Script:
Use the save_to_file(data, "fruits.txt") function to save the list of strings to a text file named "fruits.txt".                                              Ensure that the script creates the file and writes the strings correctly.

infile = open('fruits.txt', 'r')                                        
data = infile.read()                                                           
print(data)                                                                    
infile.close()
